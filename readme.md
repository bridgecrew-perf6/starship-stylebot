# Deploy Starship - Stylebot styles

The CSS styles in ```stylebot.css``` are intended to add some quality of life improvements to the Starship browser game
whilst it is still in it's rough-and-ready alpha stage.

You must use the Chrome extension [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en-GB) 
to apply the styles, whilst on the Starship game site.

## Features

- Added CSS-only tooltips to nav menu
- Made the in-game chat more usable by making it much bigger
- Added a background to the modals - stake kyanite and error messages, so it’s not just broken looking text floating on the screen
- Added a scrollbar to the screen where you choose your starship components so you can actually scroll them all easily by dragging the scrollbar.
- Made the countdown timer number always show in white, so you can actually see it (I’ve also made a TamperMonkey script to show this in hours/mins/seconds too, cause it’s easier on the brain than seeing it in seconds all the time)
- On the radar quadrant selector, I've added some text so you can easily see what number each quad corresponds to eg 0:North, 1:West, 2:East & 3:South
- On the radar/launcher screen where you try to click the parsecs from the space station - I’ve outlined the zone the game is using when you hover over the radar and displayed the section number, so you can more easily and accurately choose the zone you want!!!!!! -  you’ll see from the video, that the actual click zones don’t line up with the graphics, so it’s a bit pot-luck without this fix.
- On the screen after the radar, where you choose 1/24 solar systems, I’ve just added the system number to each one so you can more easily pick the one you want without having to count them!!!!!
